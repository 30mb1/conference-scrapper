Security and Privacy has become an essential concern of applications and systems throughout their lifecycle. Security concerns have rapidly moved up the software stack as the Internet and web have matured. The security, privacy, functionality, cost and usability tradeoffs necessary in any practical system can only be effectively achieved at the data and application layers. This new conference provides a dedicated venue for high-quality research in this arena, and seeks to foster a community with this focus in cyber security."

The development and application of new technologies continues to enable new ways of working together and coordinating activities. Although work is an important area of focus for the conference, technology is increasingly supporting a wide range of recreational and social activities. CSCW has also embraced an increasing range of devices, as we collaborate from different contexts and situations. The conference brings together top researchers and practitioners from academia and industry who are interested in both the technical and social aspects of collaboration."

Robots may become our co-workers in factories and offices, or maids in our homes. They may become our friends. As we move to create our future with robots, hard problems in human-robot interaction (HRI) exist, both technically and socially. The Fifth Annual Conference on HRI seeks to take up grand technical and social challenges in the field - and speak to their integration. HRI is a single-track, highly selective annual conference that seeks to showcase the very best research in human-robot interaction with roots in robotics, psychology, cognitive science, HCI, human factors, artificial intelligence, organizational behavior, anthropology, and many other fields. We invite broad participation."

The research study of how the understanding of computation develops, and how to improve that understanding, is critically important for the technology-dependent societies in which we live.\nLearning: Computing education is naturally concerned with how students make sense of computational processes and devices in formal education, including primary, secondary, and post-secondary institutions.

Key seminal works have been published in these two workshops and papers accepted for publication there attracted over 9,000 citations in total. Year after year, the two communities grew closer and the overlap between their respective scope got bigger.

In its first two years as a Workshop, attendance was limited, but now as a conference it is open to all interested in attending.\nPapers are submitted in May with notifications in July and camera-ready papers due in August.

It was the beginning of what at first would be a slow but steady development of the field of Intelligent User Interfaces. Three years later, the book \"Intelligent User Interfaces\" was published edited by Joe Sullivan and Sherman Tyler, the organizers of the workshop. The book highlighted the main papers presented in the workshop and served as a basis for not only future work, but also future events that continued that work. It was not until 1993, however, that Bill Hefley organized the First International Workshop on Intelligent User Interfaces, which took place in Orlando, Florida. The event, sponsored by ACM, attracted a nascent group of researchers whose work clearly defined the field as a novel and promising intersection of Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction."

    "description": "The ACM Symposium on Spatial User Interaction (SUI) is the first international symposium focused on the user interface challenges that appear when users interact in the space where the flat, two-dimensional, digital world meets the volumetric, physical, three-dimensional (3D) space we live in. This considers both spatial input and 3D output, with an emphasis on the issues around interaction between humans and systems.Due to the advances in 3D technologies, spatial interaction is now more relevant than ever. Powerful graphics engines and high-resolution screens are now ubiquitous in everyday devices, such as tablets and mobile phones. Moreover, new forms of input, such as multi-touch, finger and body tracking technologies are now easily available. In this environment, spatial UIs are transitioning out of the research community and game industry. More and more commercial 3D systems with spatial interaction capabilities exist, many priced at the consumer level. Until now, the"

As such Web Science, and thus this conference, is inherently interdisciplinary and integrates computer and information sciences with a multitude of disciplines including sociology, economics, political science, law, management, language and communication, geography and psychology. This conference is unique in the manner in which it brings these disciplines together in creative and critical dialogue."
